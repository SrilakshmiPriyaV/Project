# Project
Aim:
The problem statement is to create a prototype using a microcontroller that can alert the user when the sludge level in a water tank exceeds a certain threshold, indicating that the tank needs cleaning. In other words, the goal is to design a system that monitors the sludge or sediment level in the water tank and provides a timely notification to the user when maintenance or cleaning is required to ensure the water quality and tank efficiency.

Results:
The circuit has been implemented using a non insulated ultrasonic sensor. Hence, we measure the sludge level assuming the tank is empty. To measure the sludge level when under water in the tank, we require sensor which is insulated for the water condition.
